# States Application

This is a small app I made for learning purposes. It does CRUD operations with the names of US states. Here I used Spring Boot, Spring Data Jpa, H2 and Lombok on the backend and Angular on the frontend.

## Requirements

* Java 8
* Maven
* Node.js
* npm package manager
* Angular CLI


## Installation and Usage
* Run `git clone https://github.com/java-entwickler/states.git` to clone this repository

### Backend
1. Open the project in your favorite IDE and run the app. The server will start at port 8080.

### Frontend
2. Open terminal in the `src/main/frontend` folder and run `npm install`
2. Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Documentation
1. GET http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs for json documentation
1. Or go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html for interactive UI documenation
